			<p>A little about me.  I grew up in Michigan, raised by parents who immigrated here from South Korea, who came here looking for opportunities; chasing the <a class="dotted-gray" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream" target="_blank">American Dream</a>.  Growing up, in a Korean family, there were certain expectations.  Most important of them all, was the expectation to succeed and fulfill their dreams of having children that they could be proud of.  If that didn't quite pan out the way they thought it would, you ended up helping out with the family business.  And when you weren't helping out with the family business, you were (supposed to be) studying.  And, if you had free time, you were expected to use that time wisely... learning the piano.</p>
			<p>I joke about it now and, yet, it was from those humble beginnings that I started down life's path in the pursuit of expressing my creativity.  It was early on in life, that I discovered a penchant to create (drawing, painting, etc.) and appreciate art.  And from those early days, in middle school, learning the drawing basics with color chalk, to playing with the high school orchestra at the <a class="dotted-gray" href="http://dso.org" title="Detroit Symphony Orchestra" target="_blank">DSO</a>, creativity took hold and shaped my way of thinking and cultivated in me a deep appreciation of the arts and design.</p>
			<p>My path in life has taken me to faraway places (China, South Korea, and Tibet) for years on end, and I have been fortunate that, despite their reservations, my family has been supportive through it all.  It's that support, and those once-in-a-lifetime experiences that fuel my passion to continue learning and perfecting good design.</p>

			      <h4>Golfing</h4>
			      <p>I recently, within the past couple of years, took up golf at the advice of my friends and brother-in-law who I refer to affectionately as "Uncle Bennie".  Previous experiences in the past taught me that I might not have enough patience for the game and wanting to smash, and swing at, the ball like "Happy Gilmore" did not help.  3 years and hundreds of boxes of golf balls later, I'm now just starting to keep score.</p>

			      <h4>Snowboarding</h4>
			      <p>Let me just start out by saying that I'm not nearly as good as <a class="dotted-gray" href="http://www.shaunwhite.com" alt="Shaun White" title="Shaun White" target="_blank">Shaun White</a>, <a class="dotted-gray" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Rice" alt="Travis Rice" title="Travis Rice" target="_blank">Travis Rice</a> and any number of pro boarders (really... who is?), but I do enjoy it... <em>immensely</em>.  I <em>love</em> it.  Living in Michigan, with it's sprawling hills doesn't quite make for good snowboarding.  In 2010, however, in a moment of sheer epicness, a couple of friends and I made a trip to Salt Lake City, Utah.  It was some of the best <a class="dotted-gray" href="http://pow.urbanup.com/217231" alt="pow" title="pow" target="_blank">pow</a> I'd ever seen.</p>

			      <h4>Painting</h4>
			      <p>Having started out at an early age with painting, it wasn't until recently, that I took up painting once again.  Turned out that the classes I needed to take for the "Fine Arts" cognate, helped me regain my love and appreciation for art.  Sure, I gained knowledge of the processes of creating art such as the rule of thirds, horizon lines, vanishing points, et cetera.  More importantly, they awakened in me a long dormant outlet for creativity.</p>

			      <h4>Drawing</h4>
			      <p>Drawing has always been a part of my life in one form or another.  Much like the painting class over the summer, drawing class brought out in me another outlet to express my creativity.  Our concentration in class focused mainly on techniques and realism in relation to the human figure, perspective, vanishing points and shading.  I enjoyed projects that allowed me freedom to determine the subjects and overall meaning.</p>

			      <h4>My Love</h4>
			      <p>For most of my relatively young life, I had been living with the understanding that having a significant other was a complication.  It was something that would complicate my life unneccessarily on the quest to reach my life goals.  But, when I met Bonnie several years ago, that notion and everything that went along with it was flipped on its head.  She is and has been my equal, my right-hand, my love, and my main source of inspiration.</p>

			      <p>Our journey through life is filled with times of happiness, joy, sadness, disappointment, uncertainty, hope, and fear.  Friends and relationships, like the changing seasons, are here today and gone tomorrow.  One thing that remains a constant throughout is <strong>family</strong> and their unconditional love and support.  They inspire me to become more, do more, and be a better person.</p>

			      <p>Friendships much like the people in our lives come and go.  Sometimes, people move on and you lose touch with them.  And then there are the friends who no matter how much time has passed, live thousands of miles away, or have been in your life for as long as you can remember, stay your life in some capacity.  It is those friends that become a source of inspiration in your life.</p>
