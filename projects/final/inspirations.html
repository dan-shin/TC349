	  	<h2>“The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same.  Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.”
			<br>
			<br>­
		‐ Don Williams, Jr.</h2>
		<p><strong>FAMILY</strong>: Our journey through life is filled with times of happiness, joy, sadness, disappointment, uncertainty, hope, and fear.  One thing that remains a constant throughout, no matter the situation, is family and their unconditional love and support.  They inspire me to become more, do more, and be a better person.</p>
		<p><strong>FRIENDS</strong>: Friendships much like the people in our lives come and go.  Sometimes, people move on and you lose touch with them.  Other times, you find out that, people who you thought were you friends, they really aren't.  And then there are the friends who no matter how much time has passed, live thousands of miles away, or have been in your life for as long as you can remember, stay your life in some capacity.  It is those friends that can be honest and call you out, be there when you need someone to talk to, and offer encouragement when times are tough, that are the ones worth holding on to and, by doing so, become a source of inspiration in your life.</p>
		<p><strong>ART</strong>: I am constantly inspired from what I see in the art world with regards to the mediums that are used, the subject matter, and the thought, meaning and processes that goes into creating them.</p>
		<p><strong>MUSIC</strong>: The ideas, themes, and lyrics in music help to inspire me and my work.  It also serves as a soundtrack for when I work on projects.</p>
