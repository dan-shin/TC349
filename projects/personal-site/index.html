			<p><img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/A-10-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="A"/> little about me.  I grew up in Michigan, raised by parents who immigrated here from South Korea, who came here looking for opportunities and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream" target="_blank">American Dream</a>.  Growing up, in a Korean family, there were certain expectations.  Most important of them all, was the expectation to succeed and fulfill their dreams of having children that they could be proud of (so that they could go and brag about you to their friends).  If that didn't quite pan out the way they thought it would, you ended up helping out with the family business.  And when you weren't helping out with the family business, you were (supposed to be) studying.  And, if you had free time, you were expected to use that time wisely... learning the piano.</p>
			<p>I joke about it now and, yet, it was from those humble beginnings that I started down life's path in the pursuit of expressing my creativity.  It was early on in life, that I discovered a penchant to create (drawing, painting, etc.) and appreciate art.  And from those early days, in middle school, learning the drawing basics with color chalk, to playing with the high school orchestra at the <a href="http://dso.org" title="Detroit Symphony Orchestra" target="_blank">DSO</a>, creativity took hold and shaped my way of thinking and cultivated in me a deep appreciation of the arts and design.</p>
			<p>It hasn't always been smooth sailing, my path in life took me to faraway places (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet" title="Tibet" target="_blank">Tibet</a>) for years on end, I have been fortunate that, through it all, my family has been supportive.  It's that support, and those once-in-a-lifetime experiences that fuel my passion to continue learning and perfecting good design.</p>
