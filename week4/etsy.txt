Etsy.com | CritiqueEtsy is an online marketplace of handmade goods.  Once you’ve signed up for the site, you are able to sell and purchase handmade goods in many different categories, from small accessories and glass to furniture and woodworking.  It very much reminds of eBay with the exception that all of the items have a single price. The site features a color palette that is pleasing to the eyes and the site, overall, looks very professional.  Important account links such as login, and register are located, conveniently, next to the “Etsy” logo.  The search bar appears at the top as well and is prominent and center.  The cart button is made clearly visible and sits to the right of the search field and makes it easy for the buyer to see what is in their cart at any time.  Navigation links for categories line the left side for easy access from the home page.  Additionally, handpicked items are shown to the customer ideas and placed, prominently in center, into tiles on the front page.  When accessed from a mobile device Etsy.com automatically changes resolution and makes important the handpicked items and categories.    The main functions of account management, search, and shopping cart are still there.  In fact, it very much resembles the full site in almost every way.  It’s got a smaller “form factor” and, still, is excellent in its consistently and usability.   You get the sense that you’re still on the same page and that nothing of major importance has changed in terms of functionality and that is a good thing.That said, I really do not have any issues with the site.  It’s incredibly clean, light, and serves it’s purpose, as a marketplace, very well.
