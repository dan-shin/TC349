My Dev Environment:

My first entry into the world of the web began with the earliest versions of Adobe GoLive.  It was good for what it was and did the job.  Because, and I am ashamed to admit this, I was that guy that drag and dropped stuff into a page to make HTML.  So, in that sense, it served my purpose well.  If my memory serves me right, however, it had a bad habit of creating or leaving all types of unnecessary code during the editing of a page, such as when something was deleted.  And all that unnecessary code would begin to build up and hinder the render speed of my pages.  As I began to learn HTML, I was introduced to Macromedia Dreamweaver, and it was, as you can imagine, a revelation.  Well, part revelation and part me knowing how to actually code.

In addition to Dreamweaver, I use Adobe Photoshop extensively for website graphics, background images, and, besides Omnigraffle, for mockups.  I have also dabbled a bit in Illustrator as, from what I understand, vector graphics are better for the web.  At work, I have been using Tortoise SVN for subversion.  I am finding, however, Git to be a better all around solution and I just love the compatibility with Macs.  Speaking of Macs, I have just begun, in recent years to use it as a platform because of its ease of use.  I love how Macs have the ability to have the desktop span multiple screens.  It’s perfect for dev because I can have Dreamweaver on one desktop and my Chrome browser in the other and switch between the two effortlessly.  And that is my dev environment.
