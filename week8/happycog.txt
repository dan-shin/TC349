Site Critique | Happycog.com

Happy Cog is a web design, web development firm out of New York.  They specialize in creating web experiences for the web that balance style and use and work on any device that gets an internet connection (mobile and desktop).  Besides that they offering hosting services which power many well known sites, such as "A List Apart", on the web.

The Happy Cog site, out of all the site critiques this semester, is my favorite.  It's heavy on simplicity and content.  The color palette of red, gray, and white works really well and text is easy to read and, all together, it conveys a sort of happiness that is associated in working with them.  The navigation of the site is simple and easy to use.  When scrolling down the site, it attaches itself to the top of the browser and scrolls with you.  Very slick.  And, again, it's nice, big and readable, making it useful on mobile platforms, such as an iPad as well.  I love that they not just talk about their expertise on various platforms and that they show that expertise through their website.
