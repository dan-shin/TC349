SITE CRITIQUE | Jason Santa Maria

Simplicity, and functionality are words that come to mind when looking at Jason’s site.  The footer and header are ever present, there to guide you and keep you informed.  The color palette is fantastic and, as this is a site that shows Jason’s favorite reads and articles, it, appropriately, is easy to read.

The simplicity of the site is refreshing.  Pages (categories) on the site are kept to a minimum.  It is like he sat down one day and said, “I want the site to be about me and the publications and articles that I want to share with everybody on the web.”  As I often feel that blogs on the web lack direction, Jason’s site is great because it does not pretend to be something all-inclusive.  It’s clearly focused on one goal and one goal only.  No filler here.

Functionality describes the ability to navigate the site with great ease.  Never once did I feel “lost”.  The placeholder above the navigation links reminded me of where I was in the site and the search box, predictably, was in the footer.  What impressed me the most, however, was that the site was built with responsive design in mind.  As I shrank the browser screen, the objects would slide into a single column and enlarge in size.  This made the site entirely usable for anyone wanting to view Jason’s site from a web enabled device such as a mobile phone or tablet.
