<h3>Professional Bio</h3>
<p>Dan Shin is a student from Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan.  He studies <a href="http://tism.msu.edu/interactive-and-social-media-concentration" target="_blank">Media &amp; Information (Interactive and Social Media)</a> at <a href="http://www.msu.edu" target="_blank">Michigan State University</a>, and is drawn to Information Architecture and its use in the design and usability of interfaces on the web.  With the importance of the web on the rise, in such devices as smart phones, smart connected televisions, and retina display enabled laptops, to name a few, the field of Information Architecture continues to grow in its significance.  Of particular interest to Dan Shin, are the processes by which we come to understand how a typical user might use a site on their specific device(s) and what can be done to make that experience memorable for the end user.</p>  
        <p>Dan Shin is passionate about design, art and aesthetics and combines that passion with his love and understanding of the web and the people who use it on a daily basis to create his user experiences.  He often refers to himself as being a "representative for the end user" and has 5+ years of experience in working on web related projects that included responsibilities such as coding, usability and design.  He is just now finishing a stint at <a href="http://matrix.msu.edu" target="_blank">MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences</a> on the campus of Michigan State University.  Under their guidance, Dan Shin was able to expand his current knowledge of the web, and gain insight from working within a team orientated environment.  His responsibitlies included discussions with clients, the creation of mockups and/or wireframes, and the completion of projects (front-end development).
        <p>Along with his most recent experiences, Dan has also worked on projects for clients overseas.  From 2003 to 2008, he traveled, lived and worked in China.  It was during that time, as a business partner, that he ran and developed much of the internet for an online Tibetan art gallery, an eBay business, and an import/export (stone) company.  Dan's time overseas was a testament to his patience and ability to work in any environment and come up with outstanding results.</p>
        <p>Keeping up with innovations and standards on the web is never an easy task.  Here are some of the publications that Dan reads on a daily basis to keep up with the industry.</p>

<p>Besides working on projects, Dan loves and is passionate about his family (including his little niece who was born this past July), his girlfriend, and his dog.  Truly, they are inspirations.</p>
<p>Dan lives by the following motto, <blockquote>"The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same.  Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.‚Äù</br></br>- Don Williams, Jr.        </blockquote></p>

    	<h3>Site Critique | <a href="http://www.panic.com" target="_blank">Panic.com</a></h3>
        <p>Panic is a maker of Mac based software.  And, to that end, they feature their programs, such as Transmit, a popular FTP client, prominently on their site.  The simplicity of the site is to be applauded in the sense that it only takes a click or two to find information on their products.  The graphics and icons are well done and colorful and the colors on the site are pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in terms of positives, that is about it.  They did not take into consideration the needs of the mobile user.  Or any user that might try to view their site on a mobile device (iPad, smart phones).  Their site does not degrade at all on lower resolution screens.  I found that, when browsing their site from my mobile phone, that it kept its relatively large resolution.  Icons do not get smaller.  And this, icon only navigation, made it cumbersome to navigate their site.  I found myself having to scroll horizontally to get to the icons on the right.  They would do well to consider those viewing on smaller screens.  Perhaps by allowing the icons to shrink to fit a smaller resolution screen or creating a navigation bar up top that degrades at breakpoints.</p>
